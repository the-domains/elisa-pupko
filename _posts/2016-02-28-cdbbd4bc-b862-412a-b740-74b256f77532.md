Elisa Pupko is a New York City actress who was born and raised in Seattle, WA. She was bitten by the acting bug in elementary school when an ambitious drama teacher put on a production of Hamlet and cast her as the guard Bernardo. Elisa continued performing through school and quickly fell in love with musical theatre. Receiving her Bachelor's Degree in Theatre from the University of Washington, Elisa studied dance, voice, and women's studies. After college, Elisa landed a full-time acting job in 

Seattle's Taproot Theatre, where she performed plays on social issues for children around Washington State. 

Since moving to NYC in 2007, Elisa has been continually performing both on stage and camera. Notable New York and regional credits include "The Legend of Sleepy Hollow" atEast Lynne Theatre, "The Crucible" at The Gallery Players, "The Children's Hour" at Astoria Performing Arts Center, as well as originating roles in several new musicals including "Vamped" with Left Hip Productions and "A Wonderland" at The Ice Factory Festival.  

Elisa has also appeared in several College Humor sketches, videos for Howcast Media, and as a host for About.com.  ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/8eccee8f-e753-4c6d-957e-9fc05fd2c7d9.jpg)

In 2012, Elisa founded "Treasure Trunk Theatre, LLC" which combined her love for theatre and her passion for working with children. Treasure Trunk Theatre is a nurturing place for children to develop and expand their creative energies while learning valuable skills in communication, teamwork, confidence, and compassion.  Through the theatrical arts, children will learn to use their bodies, voices, and imaginations to express themselves and be connected with the world around them.
